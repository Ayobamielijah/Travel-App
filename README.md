# Travel-app
A .py application (w/out GUI) created for a travel agency. It uses speech engine to create more accessibility options. Source code also available without voice.
There are two source codes, the first is the Source File with Speech engine, this is relatively new and more updated. Although incomplete, it loops and has more features.
The Source file without speech engine does not loop and is an older version.
